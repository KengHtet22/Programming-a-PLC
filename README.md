# Programming a PLC

Semestral project from Programmable Controller Applications course:

We were tasked to program a Programmable Logic Controller(PLC) from Siemens called SIMATIC S7-1200 using TIA Portal to carry out a sequence of commands depending on the type of project assigned to us. I was given a porject that involves sanding two arms of an U-shaped casting.
